##Exercise 1:
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
Extras:
Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

##Exercise 2:
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.


If there are any problems or more efficient way to write this program, please tell me!
