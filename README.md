Question 1:
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

If there are any problems or more efficient way to write this program, please tell me!
